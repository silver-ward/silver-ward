## More about me:
- I'm learning to read sheet music on the guitar 🎼;
- I've a bit of experience with agroforestry 🌳🌱;
- I have a degree in English Teaching (if you ever find any errors, it's only because I was trying to be chill and laid back, obviously);
- In the future, I see myself making educational games that are actually fun.

#### Looking to collaborate on web, educational, AI, and gaming projects!
