## Hello!

I'm a 1st-year Software Engineering student, focused on full stack web development.

## More skills that often come in handy:
- I speak Portuguese natively and have a Bachelor’s Degree in English Language (Teaching License) (if you ever find any errors, it's only because I was trying to be chill and laid back, obviously);
- I've worked with design and image editing tools like Photoshop CC and Inkscape;

#### Open to collaborate on open source projects! 🙂
